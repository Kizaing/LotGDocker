Eternal tasks:
- Poke MightyE to keep the todo list up to date

Would be nice for 1.0 release:
- Move some other forest events onto the travel events hook as well.
- Change the way mounts are enabled in certain areas only in order to be
  consistent.
- Explain the advertising opt-out link (cost, etc) in the lodge.

Miscellaneous suggestions to be worked on 'sometime':
- Have a method for allowing the village to decide the 'danger level'
  of travel between any other place and it.  Or to require the trip to
  be something other than just fights (for instance, the way Strider has
  the Eythgim village set up on Legendgaard).  Aes' worldmap module is a nice
  start on this.
- Implement two-pass hotkey system so that links which want a specific hot-key
  get first choice.
- Make an in-game task list for deletions/cleanup so that all of it isn't
  run in big chunks.

Ideas which probably won't be done anytime soon:
- Suggestion by JRMinga: it seems less glorious somehow to have the statue
  only in d'burg. perhaps at least in one's home city, one can see a
  representation of the latest DK of that race?
- anyanka wants an internal description for clan members in addition to the
  external description for all and a motd for clan members
- investigate alternate gem procurement methods (black market?)
- investigate means to talk in the village after a person is dead
  (Ramius, costing a few favor?)
