The Riddles module will unfortunately not install correctly, but this is a quick fix to get it working again :)

STEP 1: In your Superuser Grotto select Run Raw SQL
STEP 2: Paste the following in the text box to create the table:

CREATE TABLE `riddles` (id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, riddle mediumtext NOT NULL, answer tinytext NOT NULL, author varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'System', PRIMARY KEY  (id));

STEP 3: Next paste this to populate the table with riddle data:
